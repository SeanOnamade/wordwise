### **1. Sarah Chen – ESL Graduate Student**

> *Subject: Request for Extension on Paper Submission*

Dear Professor Adams,
I am writing to **request for** a short extension on my recent submission. I have been working deligently on the paper, however I encounter difficulties in clearly **express** some of the methodology.

The topic is quite complex and I want to make sure the arguments **are logic and clear**. I believe that with two more days I can improve the structure and reduce ambiguity.

Please kindly let me know if this is possible. Thank you very much for your understanding and support.

Sincerely,
Sarah Chen

**Notable LanguageTool-catchable errors:**

* “**request for**” → “request” (unnecessary preposition)
* “**deligently**” → “diligently” (spelling)
* “**express**” → “expressing” or “express clearly” (verb usage)
* “**are logic and clear**” → “are logical and clear” (word form)

### **2. Ben Rodriguez – Project Manager**

> *Slack message to team*

Hey team,
Let’s **ensure to send** the final proposal to the client **until Friday**. We want to keep a professional impression and avoid any delays.

Also, the budget section **have been updated** with the correct figures, so no need to revise again.
If you have questions, reach me anytime — I’ll be in calls most the afternoon.

Thanks!
– Ben

**Notable LanguageTool-catchable errors:**

* “**ensure to send**” → “ensure that we send” (incorrect verb construction)
* “**until Friday**” → “by Friday” (preposition misuse)
* “**have been updated**” → “has been updated” (subject-verb agreement)
* “**most the afternoon**” → “most of the afternoon” (missing preposition)

### **3. Maya Patel – Content Creator with Dyslexia**

> *Blog post excerpt*

Learning how to stay productive is hard — especially when your brain just wants to **waist** time watching funny reels. 😅
But here's the thing: Productivity doesn’t mean **doing-all-the-things**, it means doing the *right* things. And sometimes, that means just takeing a break and resetting.

You don’t need to do *everything*, you just need to do what **matter’s** most.

**Notable LanguageTool-catchable errors:**

* “**waist**” → “waste” (homophone misuse)
* “**doing-all-the-things**” → flagged for nonstandard punctuation or wordiness
* “**takeing**” → “taking” (spelling)
* “**matter’s**” → “matters” (incorrect apostrophe)
