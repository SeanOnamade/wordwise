# WordWise: Context & User Personas

## Context: Why Now?

The rapid advancement of generative AI and large language models has created an unprecedented opportunity to democratize high-quality writing assistance. As remote work and digital communication become the norm, the ability to communicate clearly and professionally in written English has become crucial for global participation in the knowledge economy.

Traditional grammar checkers focus on basic corrections, but modern AI-powered tools can provide contextual, nuanced feedback that helps non-native speakers not just fix errors, but truly improve their writing skills. The convergence of real-time web technologies, sophisticated language models, and accessible cloud infrastructure makes it possible to deliver enterprise-grade writing assistance to anyone with an internet connection.
