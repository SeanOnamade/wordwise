SCORE RANGES
  80 – 100  ✅ Pass – Strong performance with all core features; may include stretch goals.
  60 – 79   ✅ Pass – Major issues present; must fix before considered complete.
  < 60      ⚠ Needs Resubmission – Incomplete delivery; must fix core issues.

SECTION TOTALS
  Project Foundation………… 10/10 (100%) ✅ EXCELLENT - Multiple personas, strong "Why Now"
  Technical & Execution…… 24/35 (69%) ⚠ MAJOR AI GAP - No actual AI integration, only rule-based LanguageTool
  Deployment & Docs……… 11/15 (73%) ⚠ MISSING DEMO - No video walkthrough, excellent documentation otherwise
  User Experience………… 23/25 (92%) ✅ STRONG - Comprehensive accessibility, wireframes, real-time UI
  Evaluation & Stretch…… 8/10 (80%) ✅ GOOD - Clear criteria, stretch goals planned but not implemented
  Bonus……………………… 6/10 (60%) ⚠ PLANNED NOT BUILT - Integration plans without implementation

OVERALL SCORE……… 82/105 (78%) ✅ PASS - Major issues present; must fix AI integration before complete

CRITICAL GAPS TO ADDRESS:
🚨 AI Integration Failure - Product claims "AI writing assistant" but has zero AI (only LanguageTool rules)
🚨 Missing Demo/Walkthrough - No video demonstration of features
⚠️ Implementation vs Planning Gap - Many features well-documented but not built
